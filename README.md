# Student Registry Simulator Program

## Overview  
This project creates a student registry program with Java, utilizing various features such as file IO, exception handling, Java Collections, objects and classes, inheritance, scheduling capabilities, and interfaces. 
 
Implementing scheduling algorithms with various data structures, such as TreeMap, enhances the efficiency and performance of the program. Additionally, the code is extensively commented on to ensure readability for anyone seeking to understand the code structure and syntax. Through these efforts, the project aims to deliver a robust and user-friendly student registry solution.


## Main Features
**File IO and Exception Handling:** Implemented functionality to read student names and IDs from a file named students.txt. Robust exception handling ensures smooth file operations.

**Utilization of TreeMap:** Utilized TreeMaps for optimized data storage and retrieval, using student IDs and course codes as keys.

**Implementation of Scheduler Class:** Programmed a Scheduler class to manage course scheduling, with methods for setting lecture day and time, clearing schedules, and printing timetables. Custom exceptions ensure error handling and data integrity.

**Enhancements in StudentRegistrySimulator:** Implemented three new commands: "SCH" for scheduling courses, "CSCH" for clearing schedules, and "PSCH" for printing the entire schedule. Robust exception handling provides user feedback.

**Comprehensive Documentation:** The code is well-commented to facilitate understanding for learning purposes, ensuring readability and ease of comprehension for any other developers seeking insights into the implementation of this Java program.
